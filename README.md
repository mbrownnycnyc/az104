# post exam
* This exam was fairly difficult.  The scenarios are difficult to pull apart, even if you know concepts and definitions.  It became clear after only about five questions that for one to feel comfortable, you must have worked as an Azure admin hands-on for several months.  It was extremely tough to get through and I was truly lucky to have done this on the first shot.
* My goal is what it always is when I aim to get a certification.  I focus on the training so that I learn the topic and tech; the cert is a nice bonus to have.  Being a security guy puts me in an interesting and easier scenario where I need to know the technology well enough, but I do not need to build it all exactly, as I generally can leverage dedicated engineers to help build solutions.
